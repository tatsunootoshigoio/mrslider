# mrslider - Interactive plotter for fitting SMR ratio using one of the models

</hr>

### Process thickness versus MR ratio data and fit it interactively

The way it works:

1. reads the data (hard coded right know)
2. plots the data
3. now you are able to adjust the fitting using sliders with the model's parameters
4. generates output .pdf with the fitting and the data

</hr>

TODO:

- [ ] add add multi model support for the fitting 
- [ ] add save to .pdf file button
- [ ] get rid of the hardcoded data and add read from file support
- [ ] code cleanup
